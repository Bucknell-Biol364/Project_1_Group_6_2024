## Data set we will use
RxP file(Data set we use)

## Objectives
Equip students who have completed Biology 201 to 204 with the skills to perform foundational data analysis and visualization using R Studio. By the end of this project, students will be able to load, view, and organize biological data, apply essential R functions, manipulate dataframes, and change data types as needed. They will understand and check data normality, create visualizations such as bar plots, single- and two-factor box plots, and line graphs, and perform statistical analyses, including t-tests, ANOVA, and linear modeling. Additionally, students will develop the ability to interpret statistical results, strengthening their competence in analyzing and presenting biological research data.
